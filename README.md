# Walmart-Time-Series-Project-

Project Introduction:
This project aims to analyze and predict weekly sales for Walmartâ€™s store number 7 using advanced time series methodologies. By examining historical data to identify trends, seasonality, and fluctuations, the
project will develop models for accurate forecasting. Reliable predictions will enhance inventory management, strategic planning, and operational efficiency in Walmart's competitive retail environment.

About Dataset:
The dataset comprises weekly sales data from 45 Walmart stores, including factors like holidays, temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rates. It supports time series analysis to investigate sales patterns
and assess the impact of these factors on Walmart's performance over time.

Project Overview:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
3. Stationarity Check
4. Model Building (ETS, Arima, Sarima, Linear Regression)
5. Model Evaluation
6. Monte Carlo

This project predicts Walmart's weekly sales using models like ETS, ARIMA, SARIMA, and Linear Regression, finding ETS with seasonal components most effective. Monte Carlo simulations assess uncertainty, while
optimization techniques help in resource allocation and decision-making, improving forecasting accuracy and strategic insights.
